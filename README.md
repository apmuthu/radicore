RADICORE is an open source Rapid Application Development Toolkit for building Administrative Web Applications, sometimes known as Enterprise Applications, which are platform, browser and database agnostic.

The project's author has stated that he has no (current) plans to use GitHub and hence the unofficial mirror here. It is based on key releases only. It will be updated only when I have the time. Please use the official links above so as not to fracture the project's access and development.

The (current) purpose of this repo is to enable those who prefer the Git model of development to assist in testing and development, migration and incremental version management by forking the project in an open manner.

* Installation instructions are now contained in file `installation.html` and consequently the `readme.txt` file will stand removed.
* The readme-<YYYY-MM-DD>.txt file will now be the CHANGELOG file in the root folder.
