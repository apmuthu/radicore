This is the README file for Radicore's SOAP implementation.

(1) Copy file 'includes/config.soap.inc.default' to 'includes/config.soap.inc' and change the values to suit your installation.

(2) Copy file 'soap/include.subsystem.inc.default' to 'soap/include.subsystem.inc' and change the values to suit your installation.

(3) Copy file 'soap/test.xmlrpc_server_api.inc' to 'soap/xmlrpc_server_api.inc' and change the values to suit your installation.

If you point your browser to 'radicore/soap/index.html' you can run some of the test scripts. These will show you how to construct both the client calls and the server responses.
